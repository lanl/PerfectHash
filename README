This code is a set of hash functions to support the paper "Hash-based Algorithms
for Discretized Data" to be published in the SIAM Journal of Scientific 
Computing". The publication details are below and in the Papers.bib file in bibtex
format. 

   Robey,R.N., Nicholaeff,D., and Robey,R.W. "Hash-Based Algorithms for Discretized Data", 
   SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing, July 2013, Volume 35, Number 4, C346--C368

   The pre-publication version has the LANL report number LA-UR-12-01566.

This code has been released under an open-source Apache 2 license to
encourage further development of hashing methods. See the LICENSE file for more
information about the license and the use of this code.

Through a web search we hope to gather statistics on the use of the method
and its improvements and help to encourage more open technology transfer by LANL
and other government research organizations. This can be thought of as analagous
to journal article citations, but within software products. If code is not
distributed with a software product, a reference should be provided in a text
file so that attribution can be determined.

Under this license, it is required to include a reference to this work. We
request that each derivative work contain a reference to LANL Copyright 
Disclosure C13002/LA-CC-12-022 so that this work’s impact can be roughly
measured. In addition, it is requested that a modifier is included as in
the following example:

//<Uses | improves on | modified from> LANL Copyright Disclosure C13002/LA-CC-12-022

This code uses autoconf/automake/libtool for builds. To build the code:

./configure
make

There will be several executables built -- sort, sort2d, neigh, neigh2d, remap, remap2d, table

Each executable runs all of the methods for the mesh operation. There is a controlling
loop at the top of the main routine that users may want to modify for the algorithms
to be run. Also, there is a random number seed for varying the problem setups that is
normally off, but users may want to turn on for some investigations. Results do vary for
different problems, but the pattern does not change significantly. Also, the OpenCL library
looks for a GPU to use for the OpenCL code. This may need to be modified for your particular
hardware.

Output should look something like the following:

    Sorting Performance Results

Size,   	Qsort,    	Heapsort, 	Mergesort, 	Hash CPU, 	Hash GPU
